Test Plan for the Car Cost Comparison:
1) For now, the year manufactored, make, and model text fields should not interact with anything.
2) For the MPG, Initial Price, Annual Repair Cost, and Annual Insurance Cost text fields, ensure these values are a valid value and do not contain illegal characters.
3) The totals should not be interactable beyond just display the results.
4) The calculate button should accurately calculate the bottom set of fields.
5) The clear button should clear all the editable fields. Clear the car classes.
6) The exit button should exit the program.
7) Make sure the two cars created from the Car class are able to be editted. 
8) The yearly gas total calculation should be correct. This is done by taking the average miles driven in a year, divided it by the MPG of the car, then multiple the result by the average cost of gas. Do this for both cars.
9) If an entry is not valid for the MPG, throw the user an error.
10) For each car, if the middle three fields are not filled in, either fill in the entry with defaults if nothing is inputted (and throw a messagebox at a user), or allow the entry to be zero (for the initial price only).
11) The car that costs the most over five years should have its field highlighted red.
12) Here is the info for the two vehichles I have owned/currently owned.
