1) Validate the three entries. They should only contain single-digits numbers. Numbers over 9, less than 0, or contain non-numeric characters throw the user an error.
2) The 'I'm Feeling Lucky' should generate three numbers 1000 times to see if any of the generated numbers match the entered numbers.
3) The 'Clear All' button should clear all fields and reset the program.
4) The generated numbers should be listed when the program is ran.
5) If the numbers any generated numbers are correct, change the background of the box to green.
6) Each generated number should be listed in the listbox.
7) If the program runs 1000 times without finding the result, display a message to the user.
8) The number of attempts the program ran should be listed in the attemps text box.
