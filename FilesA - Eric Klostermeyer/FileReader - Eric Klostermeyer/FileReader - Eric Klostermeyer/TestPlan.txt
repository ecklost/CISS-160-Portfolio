Test Plan for File Reader:
1) The user need only be able to type the file name (Test1.txt, etc.) and not the path.
2) Read the file button should attempt to read a file.
3) If a file is not found under the name, throw the user an error.
4) Clear all items in the list box before adding anything.
5) If a file is found, read until the end of the file. For each line found, output to the listbox.
6) Close the file after it is finished reading.
7) Any file that wants to be read MUST be in the /bin/Debug/ folder.
