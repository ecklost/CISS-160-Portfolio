Test Plan for File Browser:
1) Continuing from the File Reader program, the button to browse for a file should be added near to the text box.
2) This time around, the user will need to provide the full path.
3) The browse button should search for any valid .txt file in an open dialog box.
4) Clicking cancel while there will set the text box to nothing.
5) Choosing a file gets the full path and puts it into the text box.
6) Much like the File Reader, the program will read the file and output the text to the output box.
7) If a file is not found, output an error to the user.
8) Clear all items in the listbox before adding anything to it.
