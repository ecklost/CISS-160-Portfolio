Test Plan for Shipping Calculator:
1) Ensure the values for the price per pound, zone cost, and capped price are correct.
2) Only allow valid entries for the weight (numbers greater than zero) and the zone code (A, B, or C).
3) Calculate should attempt to calculate the correct value.
4) The formula for total shipping cost should be: weight * PRICE_PER_POUND + zoneCost;
5) The output labels should display the correct values.
6) If the total shipping cost is over $100.00, change the value to $100.00 and display the CAPPED label.
7) Hide the CAPPED label if the total cost is not over $100.00.
8) Display a proper error message if the weight is not over 0 or if illegal characters are entered.
9) Display an error message if the user inputs a letter code that isn't A, B, or C.
10) The cost labels should be reset each time calculate is clicked regardless of the outcome.
11) In the event of an invalid entry, reset all labels.
