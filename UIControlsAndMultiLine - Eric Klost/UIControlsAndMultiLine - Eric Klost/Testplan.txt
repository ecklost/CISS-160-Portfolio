Test Plan for UI Controls and Multi-Line Program:
1) Validate that at least one car is chosen. If not, display an error message.
2) Ensure the values are reset for each calculation.
3) Test all permutations of the optional add-ons to ensure they show the result.
4) The formula for the cost of a car is:
Car Cost = Car Chosen + OptionalAddonOneCost.IfSelected + 	   				   OptionalAddonTwoCost.IfSelected + OptionalAddonThreeCost.IfSelected
5) If no optional addons are chosen, display "Options: NONE".
6) The Calculate Button should perform the above formula and display the result.
7) The Clear Button should clear all radio buttons, checkboxes, and labels.
8) The result should show display the addons that were chosen based on if they are checked or not. The newline character '\n' should be used. Concatenate as needed.
