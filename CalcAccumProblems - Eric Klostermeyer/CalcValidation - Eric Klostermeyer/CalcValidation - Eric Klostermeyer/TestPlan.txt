Test Plan:
1) Verify that all fields take only valid numbers.
2) Ensure the outputs are correct.
3) If the ending odometer reading is less than the beginning, swap the two values around.
4) If any entry box is empty, or equal to and less than zero, put in a default value.
5) The try-catch block isn't explicitly needed since we just use a default if the entry box has something we do not like. I included it in the case of an unknown error that may pop up.
6) Make sure that all calculations are correct for determining distance traveled (ending odometer - beginning odometer), miles per gallon (miles traveled / gallons), and cost of the fill-up (gallons filled * price per gallon).
