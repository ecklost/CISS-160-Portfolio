Test Plan:
1) Make sure our constants are correct.
2) Verify the text is correct for all labels.
3) The parse in the entry fields should return a numeric value.
4) Current order calculations are: cubic feet = length*width*height, cubic yards = cubic feet / CUBIC_YARD, order cost = cubic yards * PRICE_PER_CUBIC_YARD.
5) The above order calculations should be added to the running total. Increment the order numbers by one.
6) The mulch ordered text box should equal the amount in the total cubic yards label.
7) The remaining load calculation should be: TRUCK_BASE_CAPACITY - totalCubicYards.
8) If TRUCK_BASE_CAPACITY is less than the total number of cubic yards, the remaining load text box should turn red.
9) The clear button should just clear the current three entry fields.
10) The clear all should reset everything to how it was when the program started.
11) The exit button should exit the program.
12) There should be a fake logo of the "(Your Name) Landscaping Co." in the upper right. It should be non-interactable.
