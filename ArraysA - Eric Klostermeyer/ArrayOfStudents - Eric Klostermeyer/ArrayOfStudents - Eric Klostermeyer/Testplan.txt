Test Plan for Array of Students Program:
1) Ensure each entry is added to the array.
2) Only numbers are allowed for a numeric value. Throw an error if an entry is non-numeric.
3) Give a user a pop-up if the student is added successfully or not.
4) Clear out the text boxes when an entry is added successfully.
5) If more than five entries are to be added, throw the user an error.
6) If the grade is not between 0 and 100, tell the user that the number is invalid.
7) Clicking the add button should attempt to add the name and grade to the arrays.
8) Clicking on view student names and grades should display the entries in the arrays.
9) Below the students listing in the list box, display the number of students added and the average grade of them.
10) Clicking on the clear all button should clear everything out and reset everything back to its initial state.
11) The formula for the average is: (student 1 grade + student 2 grade + student 3 grade + student 4 grade + student 5 grade) / 5. This formula will adjust according to the number of students in the arrays currently.
12) If no values are entered yet, the average grade should be listed as 0 (in order to avoid a divide by zero error).
