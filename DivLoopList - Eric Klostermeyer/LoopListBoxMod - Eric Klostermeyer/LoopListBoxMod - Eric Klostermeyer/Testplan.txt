Test Plan for Loop List Box Mod Program:
1) Test entered years for validity (should only be numeric characters)
2) If the start year is more recent than the end year, swap the values.
3) Invalid entries display a result to the user.
4) Prior to listing items, remove previous items from the list.
5) Make sure we go through each year (including the start and end years)
6) Clicking on the 'Loop Thru The Years' button should actually run the program.
7) Clicking on the 'Clear All' button should reset everything.
8) If the current iteration of the year is divisible by 4 and the election checkbox is checked, concatenate ", is an Election Year" to a string.
9) If the current iteration of the year is divisible by 10 and the election checkbox is checked, concatenate ", is a Census Year" to a string.
10) All iterations through the for loop should start with "Year: " and then the current year.
11) Both checkboxes should have their respective functionalities.
